# Insight-Analysis-on-Airline-Passenger-Satisfaction
This report details the findings of a passenger satisfaction analysis conducted on a dataset of Dorset airline passengers. The study aimed to identify the crucial factors that affect customer satisfaction and provide recommendations to improve the overall customer experience.
The analysis began with four visualisations of customer satisfaction KPI, followed by a linear regression model that revealed a statistically significant relationship between passenger satisfaction and several critical factors. The analysis found that departure delay, type of flight, trip purpose, and connection type are the most vital factors impacting passenger satisfaction. Passengers who experienced delays exceeding 90 minutes had the lowest satisfaction levels, while those on holiday and intercontinental flights had the highest satisfaction. Moreover, passengers on connecting flights reported higher levels of satisfaction compared to non-connecting flights.
The analysis's results provide valuable insights into improving the customer experience for Dorset airline. The airline should focus on reducing departure delays, improving flight types, particularly city-hoppers, and providing an enhanced travel experience for business travellers. Additionally, the airline should explore ways to enhance overall passenger satisfaction for non-connecting flights.
In conclusion, Dorset airline can create a superior customer experience and foster long-term loyalty among its passengers by addressing the critical factors identified in the analysis which emphasises the importance of understanding passenger satisfaction and offers actionable recommendations for the airline to improve its satisfaction rating.
